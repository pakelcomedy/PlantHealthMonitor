Plant Health Monitoring Wiring Guide
------------------------------------

Microcontroller: Arduino Uno

1. Soil Moisture Sensor:
   - VCC → 5V
   - GND → GND
   - AOUT → A0

2. DHT11 Sensor:
   - VCC → 5V
   - GND → GND
   - DATA → D2 (with 10k pull-up to 5V)

3. Light Sensor (LDR + 10k resistor):
   - LDR between 5V and A1
   - 10k resistor between A1 and GND

4. Buzzer:
   - + (long leg) → D7
   - - (short leg) → GND

5. LED Indicator:
   - Anode (+) → D13 (with 220Ω resistor to pin)
   - Cathode (-) → GND

6. I2C LCD (16x2 with I2C module):
   - VCC → 5V
   - GND → GND
   - SDA → A4
   - SCL → A5

Make sure to share a GND line for all sensors and modules!
